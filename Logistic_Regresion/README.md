# Logistic_Regression

This is a simple logistic regression model for a target of two classes. It uses a gradient decent algorithm to calculate the weights.
Regularization Lasso and Ridge can be used in the model.

The model uses the same methods fit and predict as the sklearn logistic regression.

Additional methods measure the performance of the model such as ROC, accuracy, confusion  etc have been added.


The model doesnt handle wrong arguments from the user in most cases, it was developped as a practice to understand the logistic regression.
However suffiecient documentetion is provided.


# Comparison with already existed libraries.

A Jupiter notebook in which our model is used, compared to sklearn model and statmodels is provided.
