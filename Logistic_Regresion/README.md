# Logistic_Regression

This is a simple logistic regression model created from scratch, for a target of two classes. It uses a gradient decent algorithm and cross entropy cost ,to calculate the weights.
Regularization Lasso and Ridge can be used in the model.

Additional methods measure the performance of the model such as ROC, accuracy, confusion  etc have been added.

The model doesnt handle wrong arguments from the user in most cases, it was developped as a practice to understand the logistic regression.
However suffiecient documentetion is provided.
